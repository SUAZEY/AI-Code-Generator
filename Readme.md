This site lets users generate code using an AI from Hugging Face.

To deploy it:
- Go to your repo settings
- Scroll to "Pages"


No worries—here’s a quick troubleshooting guide to make sure GitHub Pages gives you the site URL:

## ✅ Steps to Make GitHub Pages Work

### 🔁 Let’s Make Sure You Did These Exactly:

1. **Create a Public Repository**
   - Go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
   - Name it: `ai-code-site`
   - Keep it **Public**
   - Click **Create repository**

2. **Upload the Files**
   - Click **"Add file" > "Upload files"**
   - Drag-and-drop or copy-paste the files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `ai.js`)
   - Click **Commit changes**

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Go to the **Settings** tab of your repo
   - Scroll down in the left sidebar and click **“Pages”**
   - Under **"Build and deployment"**, choose:
     - **Source**: `Deploy from a branch`
     - **Branch**: `main`
     - **Folder**: `/ (root)`
   - Click **Save**

4. **Wait ~1 Minute**  
   GitHub will build the site. After a short time, it should show:

   > **Your site is live at**  
   > `https://yourusername.github.io/ai-code-site`

## 🧪 Still not working?

### ✅ Check These:
- Your repo is **public**
- You selected the **main branch** and **root folder** for GitHub Pages
- You uploaded at least `index.html` (must exist)
- You gave it a minute or two to build the site

## 🆘 Want to Check Together?

If you paste your **GitHub username** (or repo link), I can take a look and tell you exactly what’s missing or needs fixing. Or, if you'd rather keep it private, I can walk you through checking it manually.

Would you like to do that?
